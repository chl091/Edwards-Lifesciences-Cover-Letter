        <p>I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Data Science Intern position at Edwards Lifesciences, as advertised 
            from the University of California San Diego. With a Bachelor's Degree in Cognitive Science: Machine Learning and 
            Neural Computation in progress at the University of California San Diego, and a strong foundation in Python 
            programming, machine learning models, including natural language processing (NLP), I am excited about the 
            opportunity to contribute to your team. 
 
        </p>

        <p>During college, I excelled in courses such as Advanced Programming in Python and Java, Data Science, and 
            Neuroscience. My education has been complemented by practical experience, notably as a Financial Specialist 
            at Qingdao Zhongchi Group Co., Ltd, where I utilized data analysis to guide client decisions and improve 
            financial outcomes, and as a Computer Science Tutorial Teacher at HD Education, where I designed and 
            implemented instructional materials and lessons in programming. These roles have honed my analytical thinking, 
            problem-solving skills, and my ability to convey complex information clearly and effectively.
 
        </p>

        <p>I am particularly drawn to this internship at Edwards Lifesciences because of its commitment to making a meaningful 
            difference in patients' lives through innovative medical devices. My interest in healthcare-related machine learning
             solutions aligns with the objectives of this position, and I am eager to support your business unit in data 
             preparation, develop statistical analysis plans using large language models (LLM) and NLP, and work on model
              development for healthcare applications. My technical skills, paired with my passion for leveraging technology 
              to improve healthcare outcomes, make me a strong candidate for this role. 

        </p>

        <p>Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to bring my background in data science and machine 
            learning to your team and contribute to projects that have a real impact on patient care and outcomes. I 
            look forward to the possibility of discussing this exciting opportunity with you. 

        </p>


        <p>Sincerely, </p>
        <p>Chunjiang Liu</p>
